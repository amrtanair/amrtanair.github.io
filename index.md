My name is Amrita and I am a software developer. I completed my undergrad degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita School of Engineering, Kerala. I share my name with my alma-mater, it does make for a good conversation starter :)

A little bit about my <a href="{{ '/background' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">background</a>.

I enjoy working on engineering problems which involve data, but a chance to learn something new is always welcome.

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computational Linguistics under the EMJMD program as a Erasmus Scholar, completing my first year at Charles University in Prague(Matfyz) and the second year at Saarland University, Germany. 

My resume can be viewed [here](/assets/Amrita-H-Nair.pdf).
